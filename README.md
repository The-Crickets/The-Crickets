- 👋 Hi, we're @The-Crickets, a First Robotics team from Fort Cobb, Oklahoma.
- 👀 We're interested in a little bit of everything. 
- 🌱 We're currently learning Java as a means to program our robot.
- 💞️ We wish to help other teams by sharing our code. It's not the best, but it might be a good starting place for other people. We're also open to suggestions if anyone has any.
- 📫 Contact Information: Email - frc2373@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: We were formed in 2008. Our name comes from the cricket infestation that happened in our main building at the time.
